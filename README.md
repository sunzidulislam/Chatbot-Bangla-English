## üìã Project Overview

### Tools, Libraries, and Frameworks

* **Streamlit:** Interactive web interface for ease of use
* **PyMuPDF (fitz):** High-fidelity PDF text extraction handling complex layouts
* **Regex (re):** Robust text cleaning and normalization
* **NumPy:** Efficient vector math for similarity calculations
* **Pandas:** Data management and exporting conversation logs
* **Base64:** Encoding for secure CSV download links
* **LangChain:** Orchestration of LLM pipelines and vector search

  * `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` for smart chunking of large texts
  * `GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings` for high-quality multilingual semantic embeddings
  * `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` as the conversational LLM interface
  * `FAISS` for scalable vector similarity search
  * `load_qa_chain` and `PromptTemplate` for flexible, context-aware question answering

### Data Preprocessing & Chunking

* Extracted raw text is cleaned to remove non-breaking spaces and excessive newlines.
* Recursive character-based chunking with a chunk size of 1500 characters and 400 characters overlap maintains semantic integrity and contextual continuity.
* Chunking respects paragraph and sentence boundaries by leveraging multiple separators (newlines, punctuation).

### Embeddings & Vector Store

* Google Gemini's `embedding-001` model was selected for its multilingual capabilities and semantic accuracy in both Bangla and English.
* Embeddings are stored in a local FAISS index for efficient similarity search during query time.

### Question-Answering Pipeline

* Query and document chunks are embedded using the same model to ensure meaningful semantic comparisons.
* Top-k relevant chunks retrieved by FAISS are passed to a custom prompt-based conversational chain using Google Gemini‚Äôs chat model (`gemini-2.5-pro`).
* The prompt enforces answer grounding and restricts hallucinations by instructing the model to reply only if supported by context.

## üîç Evaluation Metrics Explained

* **Cosine Similarity Score:**
  Measures semantic closeness between the query and retrieved chunks‚Äô embeddings. Scores near 1 indicate high relevance.

* **Groundedness Score:**
  Calculates the proportion of answer tokens that appear in the retrieved context, ensuring answers are firmly based on source documents.

## ‚ùì Must Answer Questions

### What method or library did you use to extract the text, and why? Did you face any formatting challenges with the PDF content?

* **Method/Library:** Used PyMuPDF (`fitz`) to extract text from PDFs.
* **Why:** PyMuPDF provides precise text extraction with control over page reading and handles various PDF layouts well.
* **Formatting challenges:** Removal of non-breaking spaces (`\xa0`) and normalization of multiple newlines were necessary. Regex was used to clean and strip whitespace, making text uniform and easier to chunk.

---

### What chunking strategy did you choose? Why do you think it works well for semantic retrieval?

* **Strategy:** Character-based chunking with overlaps using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.
* **Parameters:** Chunk size 1500 characters, overlap 400 characters.
* **Why:** Ensures chunk sizes fit model token limits while overlaps preserve sentence/idea continuity across chunks, improving semantic retrieval accuracy. Logical splitting respects paragraphs and punctuation.

---

### What embedding model did you use? Why? How does it capture meaning?

* **Model:** `GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings` with `"models/embedding-001"` from Google Gemini.
* **Why:** Optimized for multilingual (Bangla & English) semantic understanding with high accuracy.
* **How it captures meaning:** Converts text into dense vector representations encoding semantic relationships, allowing similarity calculations beyond exact keyword matches.

---

### How are you comparing the query with your stored chunks? Why this similarity method and storage?

* **Similarity method:** Cosine similarity between query and chunk embeddings.
* **Storage:** Local FAISS vector store for fast nearest neighbor search.
* **Why:** Cosine similarity efficiently measures semantic closeness in embedding space. FAISS is scalable and optimized for vector data retrieval, enabling real-time response.

---

### How do you ensure that questions and document chunks are compared meaningfully? What happens if the query is vague or missing context?

* Using the same embedding model for queries and chunks ensures comparable semantic space.
* Overlapping chunking keeps context intact.
* The question-answer chain's prompt instructs the LLM to answer only when supported by retrieved context, avoiding hallucinations.
* If queries are vague, similarity scores drop, and the system replies that the answer is not in the context, prompting clarification.

---

### Do the results seem relevant? How can they be improved?

* Current approach yields good relevance with overlapping chunking, a strong embedding model, and groundedness checks.
* Improvements include adaptive chunking based on semantic units, domain-specific or newer embedding models, larger document corpora, and reranking strategies using cross-encoders.
